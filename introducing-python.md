By Makzan

----

# Since 1991 by Guido van Rossum

----

- Python 0.9 was released in 1991
- Python 1.0 was released in 1994

[Python History](https://medium.com/@johnwolfe820/a-brief-history-of-python-ca2fa1f2e99e)

----

# Python is 

- High level
- Interpreted
- General-purpose dynamic programming language

----

# What is programming language?

- A set of rules to tell computer what to do
- Program runs exactly what we tell it to run
- Automate things to boost our productivity

----

# What Python can do for us?

- Automate repeated operations
- Fetch data through API
- Fetch data on web
- Data process with our pre-defined formulas
- Machine learning and beyond
- Web service projects

----

# Why Python?

- Easy to learn
- Reliability
- Community is big
- Library and tools


----

## Easy to Learn

- High level = less bugs
- Interpreted = can be interactive

----

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter = Interactive

----

## Reliability

- Python has a long history and latest major released has been 10 years.
- Active update and current release is Python 3.7.

----

^ Reliability, Speaking of versions

- Releasing too much and changing too fast is not good to the programmer community.

----

^ Example of Changing too fast: Swift programming language

- 2014: Swift 1.0
- 2015: Swift 2.0
- 2016: Swift 3.0
- 2017: Swift 4.0
- 2018: Swift 4.1
- 2019: Swift 5.0

----

^ Python 3.0

- 2008: Python 3.0
- 2009: Python 3.1
- 2011: Python 3.2
- 2012: Python 3.3
- 2014: Python 3.4
- 2015: Python 3.5
- 2016: Python 3.6
- 2018: Python 3.7

----

## Community

- Large community = easy to seek help
- When we face an issue, there are chance that other faces similar issue too.

----

## Library and tools

- Tons of libraries and tools available
- There are modules for almost anything we need.

----

# Why Python?

- Easy to learn
- Reliability
- Community is big
- Library and tools

----

# Installing Python

^ Default package

- Python.org

----

# Python Distributions

1. [Official package](https://www.python.org)
2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)
3. [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/)

----

# 3rd Party Modules and `pip`

`[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/)` is the Python Package Installer. It allows us to install third party modules easily.

----

# Anaconda

Anaconda distribution allows us to get started with Python easily without worrying about the installing dependencies.

----

# Benefits of Anaconda

- both GUI and Command line package installer
- Pre-installed Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebooks
- Pre-installed Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib
- Pre-installed runtime environment control

----

# Running Python

----

^ Running Python

- Running in command line / terminal
- Running in Jupyter
- Running directly on web browsers
- Running on iPad

----

^ Running in command line / terminal

1. Put python code in `anyname.py` file
2. Open terminal
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file
4. Type `python anyname.py`
